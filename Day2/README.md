### Day 2

### Description:
Fetch cryptocurrency balances from bitfinex, bittrex, and calculate profile balances. This is a little bigger than most other days will be, I had just been meaning to make something that's (somewhat) easily extensible.


### Used:
- requests
- cryptonator ticker api


### Day 3

### Description:
Added ether wallet scanning. I realize there's an API for this (as well as using pyethereum), but I used this as an opportunity to use bs4.


### Used:
- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- etherscan.io
